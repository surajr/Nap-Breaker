# Nap Breaker
Never worry about falling asleep on the bus and missing your stop again!

## Functionality

The app allows a user to specify a location on a map that would be the stop at which the user wishes to be awake for in order to get off. Once the user is within a 1 km radius of their desired location, his/her phone will start to vibrate, hopefully waking up the user in time.

## How?

used React Native for the mobile app.
